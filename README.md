## About

Snappet is a web app that allows developers to generate beautiful images of their code, making it easy to share on social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn. With Snappet, you can showcase your coding skills in an attractive, engaging way by converting raw code into visually appealing images.

Why I Built It:
- I created Snappet because sharing raw code as text often lacks visual appeal and doesn't capture attention on social media.
- There was a gap in existing tools when it came to offering enough customization for code screenshots.
- Snappet solves this by allowing users to turn their code into stunning, customizable images that are ideal for sharing.
- The goal was to provide an easy-to-use platform for creating visually striking code images with personalization options.
- Unlike other tools, Snappet is focused on offering a clean and attractive output that enhances the presentation of code.
### Built With

Snappet is built using modern web technologies to ensure a fast, responsive, and user-friendly experience.
